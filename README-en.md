## 3. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Why do I get an error or download failure when I click WAV download?**
> **A:** Suno doesn't generate WAV lossless format versions for all songs. If the corresponding WAV file doesn't exist on the server, the extension won't be able to download it and may display "Error" or "Not Found" in the status. This is normal.

**Q2: Why didn't batch download download all my songs?**
> **A:** The batch download feature only works for songs **currently loaded and visible on the page**. To get the complete list, make sure you've scrolled to the bottom of the list, or click the batch download button again after navigating to the next page.

**Q3: The download buttons don't appear on the page, what should I do?**
> **A:** Please try the following steps:
> 1.  **Refresh the page**: This is the most common solution.
> 2.  **Wait a moment**: When the network is slow, the extension may need a few seconds to add the buttons.
> 3.  If the problem persists, try disabling other potentially conflicting extensions, or contact us through the methods below.

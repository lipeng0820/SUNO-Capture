    <h1>Privacy Policy for SUNO Capture</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: June 21, 2026]</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to SUNO Capture ("the extension"). This extension is developed by SimbaLee. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines how we handle information in our extension.</p>

    <h2>No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We want to be crystal clear: <strong>SUNO Capture does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.</strong></p>
    <p>The extension does not collect personal identifiable information (PII), authentication information, financial data, personal communications, location data, or web browsing history.</p>

    <h2>How the Extension Works</h2>
    <p>The sole purpose of SUNO Capture is to help you download music tracks from the Suno.ai website. To achieve this, the extension utilizes the following browser features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage (<code>chrome.storage.local</code>):</strong> The extension uses your browser's local storage to save your download history and batch download queue. This data is stored <strong>only on your local computer</strong> and is never sent to any external server. It is used to provide you with a better user experience by preserving your download list.</li>
        <li><strong>Downloads API (<code>chrome.downloads</code>):</strong> This permission is used to initiate the file download process from Suno's servers directly to your computer. The extension acts as an intermediary to start the download at your command but does not have access to the downloaded files.</li>
        <li><strong>Host Permissions (<code>suno.com</code>, <code>suno.ai</code>):</strong> These permissions are required for the extension to inject download buttons onto the Suno website and to access the audio files from Suno's official Content Delivery Network (CDN) for download. The extension does not read or collect any other data from these sites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data managed by the extension (such as your download history) is stored locally within your Chrome browser's secure storage area and is subject to Chrome's security measures. We, the developers, have no access to this data.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
